# SuperAgent — AI Coding Agent Enhancement System

> Verify or die. Memory compounds. Leverage over toil.

## Task Routing

When a task matches these patterns, follow the corresponding skill chain:

| Pattern Keywords | Skill Chain |
|-----------------|-------------|
| bug, fix, broken, error, crash, stack trace, traceback, debug | systematic-debugging → test-driven-development |
| bug, fix, broken, error, crash, stack trace, traceback, debug | systematic-debugging → test-driven-development |

## Skills Summary

### auto-fallback
> Cost-aware routing brain — switch from Anthropic API to a free local model when the user is approaching plan limits, hitting 429 bursts, or asks to "save anthropic" / "switch local" / "rate limit" / "approaching limit". Auto-fires on complexity=trivial when budget is tight. Picks the right Ollama / LM Studio / llama.cpp model for the task complexity, runs a 3-step canary first, and switches via `superagent-switch`. State lives in `~/.superagent/`.

# auto-fallback

The cost-aware routing brain. Decides when to flip Claude Code from Anthropic API to a local model running behind the free-claude-code proxy on `http://localhost:18082`.

## Inputs

1. **Latest classifier output** — `meta.complexity` ∈ {trivial, moderate, complex}
   from `superagent-classify <task>`.
2. **Budget signal** — `superagent-cost today --json`
   - `pct_of_plan` — fraction of plan limit consumed (0..1)
   - `time_to_5h_reset_minutes` — minutes until rolling 5h limit r

### autoplan
> Auto-pipeline a plan through product, design, and eng review sequentially, then synthesize into a single plan artifact. Use when you want the full review stack without invoking skills manually one at a time.

# Autoplan

> **Ethos:** Verify or die. Rewind, don't correct. Memory compounds. Leverage over toil. Local first.

Auto-review pipeline. Sequentially runs the full product (CEO), design, and engineering review skills over a single plan input, auto-deciding intermediate questions using the 6 decision principles, and synthesizing the results into one plan artifact at `docs/plans/<slug>.md`. Taste decisions and user challenges are surfaced at a final approval gate — everything else is decided for y

### cso
> Security audit — OWASP top-10 scan, STRIDE threat model, secrets grep, supply-chain check. Output is a severity-ranked findings report.

# Chief Security Officer

> **Ethos:** Verify or die. Rewind, don't correct. Memory compounds. Leverage over toil. Local first.

## When to use
- Before launching to public / external users.
- Quarterly audit.
- When user asks "is this secure?"
- Any handling of auth, PII, payment, or LLM-driven code execution.

## Procedure

### fanout
> Run 2+ skills in parallel via dispatching-parallel-agents and merge their reports. Use when subtasks are independent (no shared state).

# Fanout

> **Ethos:** Leverage over toil.

## When to use
- Two or more skills or tasks with NO shared state.
- User asked "review this AND also investigate AND also write docs".
- Research questions across independent domains.

## Inputs
- `$ARGUMENTS` — whitespace-separated list of skill names.

## Procedure

1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` into a skill list. Reject if fewer than 2 entries.
2. Invoke `superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents` — one agent per skill in the list.
3. Each sub-agent runs its

### free-llm
> Route Claude Code through free or local LLMs via the free-claude-code transparent proxy on :18082. Triggers on "switch to free", "use local model", "no Anthropic key", "ollama", "deepseek", "use local llm", "free LLM". Privacy default is local-only (Ollama / LM Studio / llama.cpp); cloud free-tier (NIM / OpenRouter / DeepSeek) is opt-in. Token-savings questions stay with token-stats.

# free-llm

Wire Claude Code's outbound API calls through the `free-claude-code` proxy so the session runs on local or free-tier models instead of paid Anthropic. Default is **local-only** for privacy; cloud free-tier is opt-in.

## When to use

- User says "switch to free", "use local model", "no Anthropic key", "use local llm", "free LLM", "use ollama", "use deepseek".
- User has hit Anthropic rate limits or quota and wants to keep working.
- User wants offline / air-gapped operation.
- User e

### investigate
> Root-cause investigation. Enforces the Iron Law — no fixes without investigation first. 4 phases: Reproduce → Isolate → Explain → Verify. Upgrade over systematic-debugging when the bug is worth understanding, not just patching.

# Investigate

> **Ethos:** Verify or die. Rewind, don't correct. Memory compounds. Leverage over toil. Local first.

## When to use
- Recurring bugs — same symptom, different patches.
- Any issue where "it fixed itself" was ever said.
- Flaky tests, race conditions, state corruption.
- Anywhere the fix would be guesswork without more data.

## The Iron Law

**NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST.**

If you don't know WHY the bug happens, your fix is guesswork. Guesswork fixes create

### office-hours
> YC-style office hours intake. Six forcing product questions — customer, wedge, why-now, 10x, evidence, kill-switch. Output is a filled answer doc saved to docs/office-hours/.

# Office Hours

> **Ethos:** Verify or die. Rewind, don't correct. Memory compounds. Leverage over toil. Local first.

## When to use
- Brand new feature idea, no plan yet.
- Scope feels soft / ambitious / maybe-everything.
- Before autoplan / plan-ceo-review.

## Inputs
- `$ARGUMENTS` — free-text description of the idea.

## Procedure

Answer all six verbatim. Don't skip. If you can't answer → that's the signal.

**1. Customer.** Who specifically is the customer? What is their current workaroun

### plan-ceo-review
> Pressure-test a plan with the CEO lens. Challenges scope via the four-mode framework (EXPANSION / SELECTIVE EXPANSION / HOLD / REDUCTION), rethinks the problem, asks the six forcing product questions, and recommends which mode to execute. Use before committing engineering resources.

# CEO Plan Review

> **Ethos:** Verify or die. Rewind, don't correct. Memory compounds. Leverage over toil. Local first.

Pressure-test a plan through the CEO lens before a single engineer-hour is spent. Rethink the problem, challenge the scope, rate the opportunity, and recommend which scope variant to actually execute. You are not here to rubber-stamp. You are here to make the plan extraordinary — or to kill it.

### plan-design-review
> Designer's pressure-test — rate 10 design dimensions 0–10, identify fixes for anything under 7, propose top-3 highest-leverage changes. Iterative: rate → gap → fix → re-rate.

# Design Plan Review

> **Ethos:** Verify or die. Rewind, don't correct. Memory compounds. Leverage over toil. Local first.

## When to use
- Before shipping any frontend change.
- When a design feels "off" but can't name why.
- When ui-ux-pro-max output needs critique before implementation.

## Inputs
- `$ARGUMENTS` — screenshot path, live URL, or plain-text description.

## The 0-10 Rating Method

For each dimension: **Rate 0-10. If not 10, state what a 10 would look like, then do the work.**

### ship
> Full ship pipeline — detect platform, rebase on base, run tests, audit coverage + scope drift, pre-landing review, bump version, update CHANGELOG, commit in bisectable chunks, verification gate, push, open PR. Refuses to ship main/master.

# Ship

> **Ethos:** Verify or die. Rewind, don't correct. Memory compounds. Leverage over toil. Local first.

## When to use
- Feature branch is complete.
- Tests are green locally.
- You want one command to take it from "done locally" to "PR open + verified".

## Pre-flight refusals
- Refuse if current branch is `main` or `master`.
- Refuse if `git status` shows uncommitted changes that aren't part of this ship.
- Refuse if no test command can be detected.

### video-craft
# Video Craft — HTML Compositions to MP4 via hyperframes

This skill teaches the agent to author hyperframes compositions (HTML + GSAP +
`data-*` timing attributes) and render them deterministically to MP4. The render
pipeline is seek-driven and frame-accurate — preview ≠ render performance, but
preview === render visual output. Treat the composition as the single source of
truth; never try to play media or hide clips in scripts.

## When to use

- User asks for a video, MP4, or rendered mo

### webgl-craft
# WebGL Craft — Technique Library for Premium Creative Web

This skill is a router, not an implementation. It exists to answer one question:
**"What technique should I reach for, and what is its cost?"**

Do not try to implement anything from memory. Find the right reference file first,
read it, then build. Premium creative web rewards precision over breadth; the wrong
technique applied well still loses to the right technique applied simply.

## Non-Negotiables

- NEVER skip verification on build/fix tasks
- NEVER start implementing without a plan
- ALWAYS verify work before declaring done
