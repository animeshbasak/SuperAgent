## Installation

### Option 1: Copy skills to your Claude skills directory

```bash
cp -r skills/superagent ~/.claude/skills/superagent
cp -r skills/graphify ~/.claude/skills/graphify
```

### Option 2: Clone and symlink

```bash
git clone https://github.com/animeshbasak/SuperAgent
ln -s $(pwd)/SuperAgent/skills/superagent ~/.claude/skills/superagent
ln -s $(pwd)/SuperAgent/skills/graphify ~/.claude/skills/graphify
```

Also install graphify CLI tool:

```bash
pip install graphifyy && graphify install
```

## Usage

Invoke in Claude Code:

```
/superagent
```

Or just say "activate all agents" / "full power mode" — the skill auto-triggers.

## Decision Flow

```
Task received
  ├── Creative / new feature?  → brainstorming → writing-plans → executing-plans
  ├── Bug / failure?           → systematic-debugging → TDD fix → verification
  ├── 2+ independent tasks?    → dispatching-parallel-agents → subagent-driven-development
  ├── Explore codebase?        → smart-explore or graphify → mem-search
  ├── UI work?                 → ui-ux-pro-max → TDD → verification
  ├── Ready to ship?           → requesting-code-review → finishing-a-development-branch
  └── Need past context?       → mem-search → knowledge-agent
```

## Non-Negotiables (from Boris Cherny)

- ALWAYS give Claude a way to verify its work — 2-3x quality improvement
- NEVER use `--dangerously-skip-permissions` — use `/permissions` allowlists instead
- Start every complex task in Plan Mode
- After every correction: "Update your CLAUDE.md so you don't make that mistake again"
- Keep PRs small (median 118 lines), squash merge for clean history
